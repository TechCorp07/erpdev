Quote Engine Signal Handlers for CRM Integration

Signal handlers are like the nervous system of your application - they detect when
important events happen and automatically trigger appropriate responses throughout
your system. This creates seamless integration without tight coupling between modules.

Think of signals as having a team of attentive assistants who notice when something
important happens (like a quote being accepted) and immediately inform everyone else
who needs to know (like the CRM system, accounting, and inventory management).
